The Watchdog Timer 1 of the NCT6791D consists of an 8-bit programmable time-out counter and a control and status register. 
GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO3, GPIO4, GPIO5, GPIO6, GPIO7 provides an alternative WDT1 function.
This function can be configured by the relative GPIO control register.
The units of Watchdog Timer counter can be selected at Logical Device 8, CR[F5h], bit[3]. 
The time-out value is set at Logical Device 8, CR[F6h].
Writing zero disables the Watchdog Timer function. 
Writing any non-zero value to this register causes the counter to load this value into the Watchdog Timer counter and start counting down.
When Watchdog Timer 1 time-out event is occurring, GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO4, GPIO6, bit[0],[4], GPIO3, bit[3], GPIO7, bit[0], PWROK and RESETCONO# will trigger a low pulse apporx 100mS or low level by Logical Device 8 CR[F5h], bit[0] and RSMRST# will trigger a low pulse electi 250ms.
The PWROK, SLP_S3# and RSMRST# event also relate to acpi sequence, that can be control by Logical Device D, CR[F0h], bit[7] and bit[0], Logical Device D, CR[F0h], bit[7] and bit[0] as 2?b00 is normal acpi function, others timing illustrations are define in Figure 17-1 to Figure 17-3 
In other words, when the value is counted down to zero, the timer stops, and the NCT6791D sets the WDT1 status bit in Logical Device 8, CR[F7h], bit[4].
Writing a zero will clear the status bit. It. 
This bit will also be cleared if LRESET# or PWROK signal is asserted.
The Watchdog Timer 2 of the NCT6791D consists of an 8-bit programmable time-out counter and a control and status register. 
The units of Watchdog Timer counter can be selected at Logical Device 8, CR[F8h], bit[3]. 
The time-out value is set at Logical Device 8, CR[F9h].
Writing zero disables the Watchdog Timer function.
Writing any non-zero value to this register causes the counter to load this value into the Watchdog Timer counter and start counting down.
When Watchdog Timer 2 time-out event is occurring, PWROK and RESETCONO# will trigger a low pluse apporx 100mS or low level by Logical Device 8 CR[F8h], bit[0]. 
In other words, when the value is counted down to zero, the timer stops, and the NCT6791D sets the WDT3 status bit in Logical Device 8, CR[Fah], bit[4].
Writing a zero will clear the status bit. It. 
This bit will also be cleared if LRESET# or PWROK signal is asserted.
